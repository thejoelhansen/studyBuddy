4a 
5q What methods open a pseudo terminal device? 
5a A and D; Login using an SSH session & enter username and password on a nongraphical console
6q Which does *not* typically require a reboot? Recover from a hang/ kernel panic; Apply kernel updates; Apply chnages to kernel modules in current use (therefore cannot be reloaded); Apply changes to the network configuration
6a D; Apply network config changes.
7q How to access Linux from Windows?
7a Install an SSH program like PuTTY, or use new Powershell SSH commands
8q What is the name of the file in which the public key fingerprint of the SSH servers you have connected to in the past are stored?
8a D ~/.ssh/known_hosts
9q What parameter in /etc/ssh/ssh_config enables permanent use of graphical applications through an SSH session? What about one-time command line option? 
9a idk; -X for command-line option per session 
10q SSH question
10a 
11q Another SSH question
11a
12q What is a console and what is a terminal? 
12a A terminal is an environment opened on a console providing access to a nongraphical shell, typically Bash. Think the Terminal app on Mac. A console is the literal computer in front of you. While often used interchangeably, you can have multiple terminals open on your console, you cannot have multiple consoles open in one terminal. 
12e Example "Log in to a graphical RHEL console and open a terminal window"
13q Is the root account enabled by default on RHEL 9? Is SSH allowed by default? What if you don't specify a root password?  
13a Yes, it's enabled. No, SSH isn't allowed by default. If no password is provided you can't login as root. These can be changed post install. 
14q How would you change to various virtual terminals within an existing non-graphical terminal? 
14a chvt 1-6, eg; $ chvt 3 # Would CHange my current sessions to Virtual Terminal #3;
14e There are 6 virtual terminals, each with a device file at /dev/tty1 through /dev/tty6 
15q Where are pseudo terminal devices located?  
15a /dev/pts/1, etc. 
16q What does rebooting ensure? Why is this important on the RHCSA exam?  
16a All processes and tasks running have reread their configurations and initialized properly. Rebooting during the RHCSA will test critical modifications to the server configuration. If your server cannot reboot anymore after applying a critical modification, at least you know where to look to fix the issue. 
17q When is rebooting necessary (even for experienced Linux administrators)? 
17a To recover from hang/ kernel panic, apply kernel updates, apply changes to kernel modules that are currently in use (not reloaded easily)
18q What is Systemd? What is its' role in a boot/ reboot? 
18a Systemd is the first process started on server boot, responsible for managing all other processes. It makes sure all processes are stopped (which ensures data is written from memory to disk). 
19q What commands can you use to interact with Systemd to reboot or shutdown a machine?  
19a systemctl reboot or reboot; systemctl halt or halt; systemctl poweroff or poweroff. 
19e Poweroff talks to power management to shut off power to the machine, halt does not. 
20q How can you force a machine to reset?
20a echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger; This must be done from a root shell; This saves NOTHING and should be an absolute last resort.
21q What ssh arguments provide verbose output, specifies a port, and enables support for graphical applications? 
21a ssh -vpY   
22q How do you enable systemwide "X Forwarding", which starts graphical applicaitons through an SSH session? 
22a Append "ForwardX11 yes" to /etc/ssh/ssh_config
23q Copy /etc/hosts file to /tmp on server2 as user Lisa with a nonstandard port and specify a private key.  
23a scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa2 -P 50022 /etc/hosts Lisa@destinationServer:/tmp 
24q Use rsync to sync some files between remote systems. Also, what's the main benefit of rsync?   
24a rsync -rv ~/testFolder joel@server2:/tmp; -rlpnaAX = recursive, include slinks as slinks, preserve permissions, dry ruN, archive mode (compress?), archive mode *and* synch ACLs (permissions?), include SELinux context as well (huge)
24e rsync "synchronizes" the files, meaning a differential transfer
25q Use sftp to push /etc/hosts to remote /tmp directory. 
25a sftp joel@serverName; pwd; cd /tmp for remote, lpwd & lcd for local; put /etc/hosts;  
26q Create a ssh keypair with no password; copy this to a target server
26a ssh-keygen; hit enter twice to ignore password requirement; ssh-copy-id remoteHost 
27q Ch5 review question 2 
27a Ctrl-Alt-F2 will switch back from text-based login prompt to your current work on the GUI.
29q What command(s) show(s) all users currently with a terminal session open to a Linux server? 
29a who; w on RHEL GUI Terminal app?  
30q On a server with no GUI, what would you expect to be the device name used by the first SSH session? 
30a The first ssh session would use /dev/pts/0; /dev/tty1-6 are different, GUI only 
31q What command would you use to get detailed information on what SSH is doing while logging in? 
31a ssh -v
32q Initiate an SSH session with support for graphical applications.
32a ssh -X; modify server /etc/ssh/ssh_config with X11 !
33q What is the name of the configuration file to edit SSH client settings? 
33a ~/.ssh/config (not created by default)
34q What's the filename in which public keys are stored for remote users using key-based auth? 
34a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
35 do labs
