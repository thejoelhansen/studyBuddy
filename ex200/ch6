1q What should you do with the root user account to enhance system security?
1a a Don't set a password & d Disable SSH login for the root user.
2q On a default installation of an RHEL 9 server, which group does the user typically need to be a member of to be able to use sudo to run all administrationcommands?
2a d wheel;  
3q Which of the following sudo configurations allows user amy to changepasswords for all users, but not root?
3a b amy ALL=/usr/bin/passwd, ! /usr/bin/passwd root
4q Which of the following commands shows correct syntax for using a command with a pipe in a sudo environment?
4a c sudo sh -c "cat /etc/passwd | grep root"
5q Which configuration file should you change to set the default location for all new user home directories?
5a c /etc/default/useradd
6q Which command enables you to get information about password properties such as password expiry?
6a a chage -l
7q Which of the following files is not processed when a user starts a login shell? a. /etc/profile b. /etc/.profile c. ~/.bashrc d. ~/.bash_profile
7a b there is no /etc/.profile; ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc, /etc/profile 
8q Which of the following offers the best option to modify user group membership?
8a a vigr command creates a copy of the /etc/group file so changes can be applied safely.
9q Which command can be used to list all the groups a user is a member of?
9a c id & d groups
10q What can you do to ensure that no users, except for the user root, can log in temporarily?
10a c Create a file with the name /etc/nologin
10e To display an optinal message create /etc/nologin.txt
11q What methods should be used as alternatives to logging in as Root? 
11a Use su to open a subshell as root, use sudo for specific tasks, or use PolicyKit to set up graphical utilities to run with admin privileges
12q Start a subshell as root. Start a *login* shell as root. 
12a su root; su - root
12e With a login shell all scripts that make up the user environment are processed, which makes you work in an environment that is exactly the same as when logging in as that user. 
13q Grant linda sudo privileges. Revoke her sudo privileges. 
13a sudo usermod -aG wheel linda; sudo deluser linda wheel; visudo (to verify %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL); 
13e usermod option -a is append, which *adds* the user to a group. Without -a, your usermod statement will replace all existing groups a user is a member of with your new addition.
14q Grant linda access only to the passwd command, with the exception of the root user 
14a visudo or sudo vi /etc/sudoers; linda ALL=/user/bin/passwd, ! /usr/bin/passwd root
14e Tip: sudo does not allow pipes by default. use sudo sh -c "rpm -qa | grep ssh" to use a pipe with sudo. 
15q What command is an alternative to sudo? Why can it be considered more secure? 
15a pkexec (Policy Kit EXECute) also runs commands as different users. However, it relies on PolicyKit files for (potentially) finer grain permissions. Sudo *always* runs a command with unlimited access (root), whereas pkexec can run a command with only the elevated permissions it actually needs (assuming the PolicyKit file is good)
16q Define each colon dilemeted value of a typical row in /etc/passwd (user:x:1000:1000:user:/home/user:/bin/bash)
16a username, password, UID, GID, comment, home directory, login shell
16e UIDs < 1000 are typically used for system accounts, and UIDs > 1000 are reserved for user accounts
16q Where are new user account defaults configured? 
16a /etc/default/useradd and /etc/login.defs for user defaults, /etc/skel for /home/user directory
17q Where are user passwords stored? What's their format? What notes a disabled password? What notes an unset password? 
17a /etc/shadow, the hash of the encrypted password, !, !!
17e While you can manually edit /etc/shadow, it's extremely bad practice. For example, use passwd -l and passwd -u to lock & unlock a user's account.
18q What are the values in /etc/shadow? 
18a user:hash of encrypted password:date since last password change (from epoch):min days before allowed next password change (0 = no age enforced):max days until password change required:dasy a user is warned their password will expire:number of days after expiry an account is locked:expiry date of account (from epoch)
18e User:Password:LastChange:Min:Max:Warn:Inactive:Expire ... only first 6 are required, EG user:password:19732:0:99999:7:::
