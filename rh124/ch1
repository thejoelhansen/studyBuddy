6q What are some reasons to avoid Fedora? What's a poor reason?

7a D: Troubleshootin an Existing Installation is available when booting from disk but NOT on the Installation Summary screen 
8q After setting the root password that you want to use, you cannot proceed with the installation. What is the most likely reason? 
8a You have to confirm (hit done) *twice*, as you are absolutely allowed to use an unsecure root password.
9q When can the language be set in a RHEL install? 
9q Installation Summary screen, directly after booting from installation media, and after installation.
10q When installing a server that uses LVM logical volumes, you'll get *at least* three storage volumes (partitions or LVM), such as:  
10a /, /boot, and swap; /var, while maybe makes sens to be on its own logical volume, isn't separated onto its own by default.
